# Basic _rollup.js_

This is a basic starting point for an application that is bundled using [rollup.js](https://rollupjs.org)

This implementation employs the EcmaScript module format.

***Note**: JavaScript modules must be run on a server ([learn more](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Modules#Other_differences_between_modules_and_standard_scripts))

For local testing, I recommend [Live Server](https://github.com/ritwickdey/vscode-live-server) for VSCode users.\
For all others, there's likely a similar plugin/extension for your editor of choice.\
Otherwise, you can always set up an actual server.

Also, be sure to add/modify the following fields in the `package.json`

* author
* license
* name
* repository
